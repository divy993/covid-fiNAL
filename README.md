See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Translation in new languages
The project has the internationlization set up properly and you can add any language you want. Although, since the data on this website is from India, adding Indian languages would make more sense.
#### Steps
1. Goto `/public/static/locales`
2. Add your language name and 2 character language code for your language. (As an example this is already done for Hindi and English) in `languages.json`.
3. Now, make a copy of `en` folder and name this to whatever language code you put in step 2.
4. Add your translations in all the json files. If you miss any translation, the text will be shown in English as default.

This is created to keep people informed about the current state of Covid-19 in the country. If you need help, please call the emergency numbers listed on the [website here](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) or call 100.

If you feel any information is missing or there is any error, please feel free to create [an issue](https://github.com/anamritraj/livecovid.in-webapp/issues/new) or reach out to me directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anamritraj) and I would be happy to assist.

## Credits

This would not have been possible without the awesome guys at https://github.com/covid19india. I was initially scraping the MoHFW website, but then I got to know about them and since then this project internally calls their API. They are doing really awesome work maintaining a crowdsourced database of patients. Thanks to them for all the hard work!
